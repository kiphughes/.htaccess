# JavaScript MIME type issues:
#   1. Apache uses "application/javascript": http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/1.3.x/conf/mime.types
#   2. IIS uses "application/x-javascript": http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb742440.aspx
#   3. SVG specification says it is text/ecmascript: http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-SVG-20010904/script.html#ScriptElement
#   4. HTML specification says it is text/javascript: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/scripts.html#h-18.2.2.2
#   5. "text/ecmascript" and "text/javascript" are considered obsolete: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4329.txt

# Browser Caching: http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/caching.html#LeverageBrowserCaching
#======================================================================================================
# Google recommends specifying the following for all cacheable resources:
#
#    1. Expires or Cache-Control max-age
#
# 	Set Expires to a minimum of one month, and preferably up to one year, in the future. (We
# 	prefer Expires over Cache-Control: max-age because it is is more widely supported.) Do not
# 	set it to more than one year in the future, as that violates the RFC guidelines.
#
#    2. Last-Modified or ETag
#
# 	Set the Last-Modified date to the last time the resource was changed. If the Last-Modified
#	date is sufficiently far enough in the past, chances are the browser won't refetch it. 
#
# Per Google: "It is redundant to specify both Expires and Cache-Control: max-age, or to specify
# both Last-Modified and ETag."
